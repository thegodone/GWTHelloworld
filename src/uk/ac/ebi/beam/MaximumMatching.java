/**
 * Maximum matching in general graphs using Edmond's Blossom Algorithm. This
 * implementation was adapted D Eppstein's python code (<a
 * href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/CardinalityMatching.py">src</a>)
 * which provides efficient tree traversal and handling of blossoms. The
 * implementation may be quite daunting as a general introduction to the ideas.
 * Personally I found <a href="http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/">Keith
 * Schwarz</a> version very informative when starting to understand the
 * workings. <p/>
 *
 * An asymptotically better algorithm is described by Micali and Vazirani (1980)
 * and is similar to bipartite matching (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm">Hopkroft-Karp</a>)
 * where by multiple augmenting paths are discovered at once. In general though
 * this version is very fast - particularly if given an existing matching to
 * start from. Even the very simple {@link ArbitraryMatching} eliminates many
 * loop iterations particularly at the start when all length 1 augmenting paths
 * are discovered.
